*For Educational Use Only*



# Instructions
1. Download Repo and upload it to yourmcontrol server.
2. Copy bot.js and figure out a way to display it on
the webpage of your choosing. 
*Only do this with webistes you actually own*

3. Done, you can edit cmds.php with php commands of your choice, these will be run in a hidden iframe on
the target site. Also, update miner.html with your coinhive Site key so you can also make money off of the 
Botnet.





*It has been proven possible to run javascript in ads so thats an idea to think about :)*
